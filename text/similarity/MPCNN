Input format for prediction:
Sentence 1, Sentence 2
Output format for prediction:
Sentence 1, Sentence 2, Similarity score
Input format for training
The semeval-sts 2012,2013,2014,2015,2016 is preprocessed and converted into tsv format is used for training the model.
The input is in the tsv format as shown below:
Similarity_Score Sentence1 Sentence2
The Model consists of two main components:

Sentence model
Similarity measurement layer
The model consists of two main components as shown in figure:
1 .A sentence model for converting a sentence into a representation for similarity measurement; we use a convolutional neural network architecture with multiple types of convolution and pooling in order to capture different granularities of information in the inputs.
A similarity measurement layer using multiple similarity measurements, which compare local regions of the sentence representations from the sentence model.
The code is implemented in python 3.5 and tensorflow 1.0.0
The benchmark metrics used is semeval-sts 2012,2013,2014,2015,2016 for training and testing the data.
Evaluation metrics and results
Loss: 14.6
Accuracy: 80%
