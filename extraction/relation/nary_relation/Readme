Input data:
"Data_graph", which is in a json format file containing information such as PubMed articleID, paragraph number, sentence number, and the information about the tokens including part-of-speech tags, dependencies, etc. produced by Stanford coreNLP tool is given as input which is further preprocessed.
Output is to predict the relation between N entities.
 
The model uses Graph state LSTM concept which takes input graph G= <V,E>, which takes both source words and edge labels for calculating the input representation to capture non-local information, model performs information exchange between words through a recurrent state transition process, and later uses logistic regression classifier to make a prediction.
Python 2.7 along with tensorflow-gpu is used to run the code.


 
Dataset :
Biomedical-domain dataset is used fot focusing on drug gene-mutation ternary relations, which are extracted from PubMed. It contains 6987 ternary instances about drug-gene-mutation relations, and 6087 binary instances about drug-mutation sub-relations.
Evaluation metrics and results:
Accuracy for training model is 82.5%
Average Decoding time is 6.594 sec  
The Accuracy for testing is 62.5%
Decoding time is 2.938 sec
